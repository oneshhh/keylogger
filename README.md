# keylogger

I've created a keylogger as part of a personal project to explore potential security vulnerabilities in computer systems, utilizing a blend of simple yet sophisticated

code. This project has significantly enhanced my comprehension of security risks inherent in various systems.

To employ this keylogger, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install the pynput library by running the command:

pip install pynput

Create a 'keylogs.txt' file in the same directory as the keylogger script.

Once these prerequisites are met, execute the script, and it will commence recording keystrokes, storing them in the designated 'keylogs.txt' file.
